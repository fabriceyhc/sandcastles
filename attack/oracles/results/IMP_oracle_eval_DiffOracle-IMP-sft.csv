  Network allocation and network dimensioning are two distinct processes in network planning. Network allocation involves distributing network resources among various applications and services, ensuring each receives the necessary bandwidth and capacity. On the other hand, network dimensioning is the process of determining the overall size of a network required to meet future traffic demands and performance requirements. Understanding the difference between these two concepts is crucial for effective network management and optimization. By clarifying their roles, network administrators can allocate resources efficiently and dimension networks accurately, leading to improved performance and reduced costs. Network dimensioning focuses on determining the overall scale (size) of the network. * **Objective**: The goal of network allocation is to efficiently allocate existing resources, whereas network dimensioning aims to determine how much resources (capacity) are needed to ensure desired performance and availability. * **Approach**: Network allocation typically involves static resource assignment based on predicted usage patterns. In contrast, network dimensioning uses analytical models, simulations, or historical data to estimate future traffic growth and"
